---

### AI & Intelligence

- [ ] **Smart Reorder Suggestions** — Predict optimal reorder quantities from sales velocity
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis (Reviews)** — Auto-categorize review sentiment for prioritization

### Inbox 

- [ ] **Canned Responses** - These need to be rich text like the inbox
- [ ] **Canned Response Categories** - Need to be more labels than categories, they need to be editable and also able to be deleted.
- [ ] **Multi-Select Conversations** - Need option to merge conversations.
- [ ] **Merged Conversations** - the To is only listing the first email address, need to list all email addresses or other merged conversation receivers e.g. Instagram, Facebook, etc.
- [ ] **Previous Conversations** - Needs to go to a list of all the conversations (this includes the widget at the top of the sidebar in the customer information section)

### Orders

- [ ] **Order tags** - Need to be able to be removed for an order both in the order list and the order detail page.
- [ ] **Order status filter** - In the order list we need to be able to filter by order status.
- [ ] **Order Attrubiution** - Need to be able to see the order attribution in the order list and order detail page. We also need this to be visible in the PWA Order Detail Page.

### PWA App

- [ ] **Live Visitors** in the PWA app we need this to show the last 50 visitors instead of the last 3 minutes, this should not change the live visitor count.


- Visitor Profiles have the Visits Order wrong, visit 1 is actually visit 3 etc.
