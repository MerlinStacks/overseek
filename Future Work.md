The ecommerce strem doesn't seem to be working with live data

The active visitor count seems to be off also.
The live visitor log seems to be off still too.

The analytics - revenue page doesn't show any data.
the order tag mappings on the settings page is so long and big, maybe we need to update this ui and put it in a seperate tab on the settings page.

the gold price configuration on the settings page needs to be in a seperate tab on the settings page and only show if the account has this enabled.

We can get rid of "Auto-Configure Plugin" on the settings page.

In  the superadmin settings we need to have a smtp details for the platform to send emails, this will be different than the email automations for the users.
